I am a Postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/">Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics</a> in Waterloo (Canada) and <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/physics/">Carnegie Mellon University</a> in Pittsburgh (United States). I am passionate about theoretical cosmology and theoretical physics in general. For more details, see my <a href="https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/personal/jfeldbrugge/">personal website</a>. On this website, I share the documentation of a couple projects:

* <a href="https://jfeldbrugge.github.io/Schrodinger/"> Schrödinger code</a>: Quantum mechanics is a fundamental in physics describing the evolution of non-relativistic quantum systems. In this webpage, I solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation using the Suzuki-Trotter method. I illustrate the code with a one- and two-dimensional example.

* <a href="https://p-lpi.github.io/"> Picard-Lefschetz code</a>: Oscillatory integrals are fundamental to physics but subtle to define and often difficult to evaluate. Using Picard-Lefschetz theory, I develop a new method to evaluate multi-dimensional oscillatory integrals. The code is demonstrated with several lensing problems in wave optics.

* <a href="https://jfeldbrugge.github.io/One-piece-Cody/"> One-piece Cody kite</a>: In the nineteenth century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Franklin_Cody">Samuel Franklin Cody</a> developed the *Cody War-Kites*, which were large kites able to lift persons to great hight, and were used by the British before World War I as a smaller alternative to balloons for artillery spotting. More recently, Ton Vinken developed an adaptation of the Cody kite which can be constructed out of a single piece of material. Unfortunately, it is currently difficult to find plans online. Inspired by this idea, I constructed a plan which I hope will encourage others to build the one-piece Cody kite.
